# Instagram-Like Blog in Flask


## Description
This project shows a public feed. Users can only post their messages (pictures and messages) if they are authenticated. New users can be created at any time. 
User's profile information (in particular name and profile photo) is displayed for each post.

## Build
This repo uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). 
Install dependencies at first via ``pip install -r requirementes.txt`` and then run web server via ``python main.py``.
Also, make sure that ``MongoDB`` listens on localhost at the default port.
